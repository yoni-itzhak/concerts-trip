# concerts-trip

This is our final project in the course "Database Systems". 

## Overview

‘Concerts Trip’ is the perfect application to help you plan a customized music-tour, based on your preferences.
In ‘Concerts Trip’ you can select when (dates), where (city/country/continent), what (genres) will be your next musical adventure. You can be strict or flexible with either of those terms, plus - you can select who you ‘Must see’ in your dream-trip! 
As we know it might be overwhelming at first, we decided to give you some recommendations, just to help you get started. If you want, you are welcome to review them on our home-page.

Once you put in your preferences, we will display the best-matching shows for you. You can then select which concerts will qualify to your exclusive-tour.
